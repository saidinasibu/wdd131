        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I'm planning a hobby sharing website.
            The main page is designed to be an attractive advertising page with useful information for your hobby. A
            child page where you can sell knitted products from the same hobby.
            I'm thinking of a child page where you can purchase knitting supplies.]</p> <!-- change this -->

            Sharing New Hobby
            If you are just starting to crochet,
            do not expect to create a masterpiece in yarn on your first try!
            Relax and follow our tips for crochet for beginners.

            You can certainly pick up crocheting by yourself,
            but it can be extremely helpful to learn alongside others—no matter their level of experience.
            If you surround yourself with more knowledgeable crocheters, you can learn from their work and ask for their
            feedback.
            On the other hand, learning among other beginners can be helpful as well, as you work through new stitches
            and troubleshoot projects together.

            Crochet for Beginners:
            Until you start to get the hang of crochet and know you want to pursue it as a hobby,
            you may be hesitant to buy crochet patterns.
            Fortunately, you can find hundreds of free crochet patterns online for all kinds of creations,
            from scarves to cute amigurumi dolls. You will likely need to spend a little time learning
            how to read the patterns—they are typically written with several different abbreviations and terms—but once
            you know the lingo,
            you can create nearly any type of project. Try browsing craft blogs or doing a simple Google search,
            and you will find a range of unique, modern crochet patterns—free!
